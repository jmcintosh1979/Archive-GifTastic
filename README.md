UCF Coding Boot Camp - Week Six Homework Assignment

## Overview
Using the GIPHY API make a dynamic web page that populates the gifs of your choice.  Must use the GIPHY API, JavaScript, jQuery to change the HTML of the site.


## Instructions
Click on one of the pre-existing animals at the top of the page to see some random GIPHY's for that specific animal.  All GIPHY's will be still, however; to animate them you can simply click on the image and it will animate.  To return back to still, click on the image again.

To see GIPHY's of animals not already listed, type in a new animal name into the field provided and select "Submit".  Once submitted a new button will appear with the animal's name that was added.  Then like before, click on the animal button and your randomly selected GIPHY's will be displayed.
